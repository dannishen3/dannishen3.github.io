This group exhibition, featuring international artists with Residency Unlimited (RU), explores a scope of gestural renewal. A Persian carpet, a running fountain, industrial-grade painting, blue chips, and solid nail polish – the works in this exhibition also serve as signifiers which draw attention to the critical transformations born of everyday-encountered matter and forms.</p>\n                </div>\n            </div>\n    \n        </Layout>\n    );\n}\n\nexport default Page"],"sourceRoot":""}
