                    <p><i>Collaborative Survival</i></p>

                    <p>What is a modern imagining of the world without narratives of unbridled economic growth. When linear progress on a forward-expanding timeline is taken away, the images formed are too often bleak to catastrophic, without humans, or overgrown by other species and geophysical forces (the apocalypse is a world without human productivity). In times of COVID-19, we have become more aware than ever of humanity’s interdependence, when pitted against a nonhuman agent. In Dark Ecology (2018), author Timothy Morton ponders: if “World War II was the viral code that broke the program of a certain imperialism, one wonders whether global warming will be the viral code that breaks the machinations of a certain neoliberal capitalism…”; today we see that viral code as a viral infection, one (of many) borne of ecological encroachment and ruination, which in turn implodes the economy, which in turn slows environmental extraction and emissions. Turning upon this path—human interdependence on what is nonhuman and the biodiversity which enables the very continuation of humanity—reveals a looping narrative of survival.</p>

                    <p>This exhibition delves further into feedback loops of human and nonhuman as reflected in the collaborative practices of seven New York-based artists: Stefani Bardin, Jenny Brockmann, Tahir Karmali, Beatrice Glow, Christina Poblador, Sean Raspet, Michael Wang and their collaborators. These new works operate at the porous peripheries of widely-accepted (often Western-centric) capitalist narratives, tracing various flora and the supply chains they make possible. Each project functions beyond binaries of apocalyptic apathy and neo-environmentalism (the belief that civilization and nature can only be “saved” by new developments in biotechnology, synthetic biology, nuclear power, geoengineering), between “folk knowledge” and the scientific method, between the anthropocentrism as well as ecocentrism (feeling for nature) that paralyze us to inaction in the face of global warming and ecocide, between success and failure, between hope and fear.</p>

                    <p>If planetary survival depends on repealing human disturbances, then for humans, it depends on the rethinking of the anthropo-. “Collaborative survival” as defined by Anthropologist Anna Lowenhaupt Tsing acknowledges that:<br></br>
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“we change through our collaborations both within and across species. The important stuff for <br></br>
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;life on earth happens in those transformations, not in the decision trees of self-contained <br></br>
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;individuals. Rather than seeing only the expansion-and-conquest strategies of relentless <br></br>
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;individuals, we must look for histories that develop through contamination...Collaboration is <br></br>
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;work across difference, yet this is not the innocent diversity of self-contained evolutionary <br></br>
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;tracks. The evolution of our 'selves' is already polluted by histories of encounter; we are mixed <br></br>
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;up with others before we even begin any new collaboration. Worst yet, we are mixed up in the <br></br>
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;projects that do us the most harm. The diversity that allows us to enter collaborations emerges <br></br>
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;from histories of extermination, imperialism, and all the rest. Contamination makes diversity.”</p>

                    <p>This exhibition thus also complicates the idea of “interdisciplinary” as a label for projects merging wholly separate disciplines—but rather as entanglement, re-assembling, shifting, or creating feedback—and ultimately about finding a common language. Embedded in the very aesthetics and structures characteristic of different fields of practice, each process also experiments with materials that are sustainable, renewable, to virtual. These artists not only challenge modes of knowledge production, but also contribute to knowledge production via the participation of various individuals in generative dialogue. By working through systems in place, these artists blur the distinction between fields in collaborative veins. Art here is transformed by collective encounter, rather than by self-containment, and offers up some alternative ways of coexisting in the world.</p>

                    <p>Artifacts, the nameless technological developments of old are considered art forms within museum vitrines today. In a reversal of Marshall McLuhan’s statement on technology and art in 1970: every work of art is created in the first place as technology, while every technology, in its repeated use, becomes a work of art. Yet technology and art have developed in separatist and futurist connotations. If “since the scientific revolution, art has become a protected cultural sanctuary; as empiricism has gradually dominated everyday cultural values and academic standards”, so-called “interdisciplinary art” has become specialized practice by assuming we are uncontaminated and not already interdependent in various ways. Further informed by the idea of rewilding (conservation biology) as model—in which the major premise is to provide connectivity between natural processes without the need for human maintenance—<i>Collaborative  Survival</i> asks how to also “rewild” the human imagination: How may we furthermore expand our understanding of “technology” beyond the term’s linear future-oriented progression, by encompassing the past and complicating the current? Beyond protheses, how do our entanglements with life on earth, objects, engineered infrastructure, to environments make us richer and stranger, and vice versa?</p>
                    <p><i>Collaborative Survival</i> opens up our imaginations and simultaneously addresses the contradictions of our times, that precarity is a part of survival. Anna Lowenhaupt Tsing asks, what if “precarity is the condition of our time...?...Can we live inside this regime of the human and still exceed it?” What if the inability to predict, is at the core of the systematicity we seek, and is a necessary condition for coexisting? </p>
