When linear progress on a forward-expanding timeline is taken away, the images formed are too often bleak to catastrophic, without humans, or overgrown by other species and geophysical forces (the apocalypse is a world without human productivity). In times of COVID-19, we have become more aware than ever of humanity’s interdependence, when pitted against a nonhuman agent. In Dark Ecology (2018), author Timothy Morton ponders: if “World War II was the viral code that broke the program of a certain imperialism, one wonders whether global warming will be the viral code that breaks the machinations of a certain neoliberal capitalism…”; today we see that viral code as a viral infection, one (of many) borne of ecological encroachment and ruination, which in turn implodes the economy, which in turn slows environmental extraction and emissions. Turning upon this path—human interdependence on what is nonhuman and the biodiversity which enables the very continuation of humanity—reveals a looping narrative of survival."),i.a.createElement("p",null,"This exhibition delves further into feedback loops of human and nonhuman as reflected in the collaborative practices of seven New York-based artists: Stefani Bardin, Jenny Brockmann, Tahir Karmali, Beatrice Glow, Christina Poblador, Sean Raspet, Michael Wang and their collaborators. These new works operate at the porous peripheries of widely-accepted (often Western-centric) capitalist narratives, tracing various flora and the supply chains they make possible. Each project functions beyond binaries of apocalyptic apathy and neo-environmentalism (the belief that civilization and nature can only be “saved” by new developments in biotechnology, synthetic biology, nuclear power, geoengineering), between “folk knowledge” and the scientific method, between the anthropocentrism as well as ecocentrism (feeling for nature) that paralyze us to inaction in the face of global warming and ecocide, between success and failure, between hope and fear."),i.a.createElement("p",null,"If planetary survival depends on repealing human disturbances, then for humans, it depends on the rethinking of the anthropo-. “Collaborative survival” as defined by Anthropologist Anna Lowenhaupt Tsing acknowledges that:",i.a.createElement("br",null),"      “we change through our collaborations both within and across species.

These artists not only challenge modes of knowledge production, but also contribute to knowledge production via the participation of various individuals in generative dialogue.

In a reversal of Marshall McLuhan’s statement on technology and art in 1970: every work of art is created in the first place as technology, while every technology, in its repeated use, becomes a work of art. Yet technology and art have developed in separatist and futurist connotations. If “since the scientific revolution, art has become a protected cultural sanctuary; as empiricism has gradually dominated everyday cultural values and academic standards”, so-called “interdisciplinary art” has become specialized practice by assuming we are uncontaminated and not already interdependent in various ways.
